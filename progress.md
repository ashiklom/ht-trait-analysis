# Next steps

- Simulations
  - [ ] Create Hypertrace configuration inputs
  - [ ] Upload to SBG cluster
  - [ ] Run Hypertrace simulations
  - [ ] For every output, run PLSR models

- Analysis
  - [ ] Figure: (Spectra) Radiance for different atmospheres, angles, etc.
  - [ ] Figure: (Spectra) Reflectance for different atmospheres, angles, etc.
  - [ ] Figure: (Barplot) Biases in trait estimates
  - [ ] Figure: (Barplot) For each trait, relative variance

- Hypertrace development
  - [ ] {Optional} Try writing Hypertrace directly to S3

# Progress

## 2022-01-06

- Added a bit of text on optimal estimation, and a few minor tweaks
- Modified Hypertrace to run in parallel and write output to Zarr
- NEXT: Do simulations!
