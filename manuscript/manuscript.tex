\section{Introduction}

Plant functional traits are measurable plant characteristics that are closely related to individual fitness and ecosystem function~\cite{violle2007let}.
Specifically, some traits (``effect traits'') directly affect ecosystem processes and are therefore valuable indicators of an ecosystem's current status, while others (``response traits'') are useful as predictors of how individuals and ecosystems will respond to future changes~\cite{lavorel2002predicting, funk2017revisiting}.
Traits provide more granular information about the impacts of environmental changes than species identity alone~\cite{cadotte2017should}.
% Plant traits are relevant to evaluating the functional diversity of an ecosystem~\cite{cadotte_2011_beyond_species, bouallala2020vegetation, bilton2010intraspecific, diaz2013functional, flynn2011functional, jager2015soil}.
Moreover, plant traits often serve as parameters in land surface and dynamic vegetation models~\cite{bonan_2012_reconciling, feng2013scale, harper2016improved, shiklomanov2020structure}.
Trait data are therefore valuable to multiple ecological subdisciplines.

Our best current understanding of plant functional traits comes from regional- to global scale trait databases such as TRY~\cite{kattge2020try} and BIEN~\cite{maitner2018bien}.
Although databases of in-situ trait measurements are larger and more open than ever before~\cite{kattge2020try}, large spatial and phylogenetic gaps and sampling biases in these datasets continue to pose a challenge in trait ecology~\cite{cornwell_2019_what}.
Fortunately, multiple decades of research have demonstrated that plant traits can be successfully estimated from remote measurements of canopy reflectance~\cite{cavender-bares2020remote, verrelst2019quantifying}.
Compared to field measurements, airborne and satellite measurements cover larger areas to reduce sampling biases, particularly in remote and rugged landscapes~\cite{jetz_2016_monitoring, marvin2014amazonian}.

Decades of remote sensing observations, at various spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions~\citep{ustin2021current}.

The advantages of remote trait mapping come at a cost of much larger uncertainties.
Uncertainties in remote trait estimation originate from multiple sources.
First, the relationship between canopy reflectance and leaf traits is usually at least partially empirical and therefore uncertain.
Second, light leaving a canopy interacts significantly with the atmosphere before reaching the airborne or spaceborne instrument;
therefore, any trait retrieval workflow must first remove these atmospheric effects (i.e., ``atmospheric correction''), a process that is also highly uncertain~\cite{thompson2020quantifying}.
Third, the airborne or spaceborne instrument is never perfect, but rather is subject to measurement constraints such as a finite signal-to-noise ratio and imperfect calibration; this introduces additional uncertainty.

The NASA Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) designated observable—a planned global satellite imaging spectroscopy mission—therefore represents a significant new opportunity for studying the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of plant traits worldwide.
An evaluation of the performance and trade-offs of SBG for trait estimation is therefore essential to the design of an SBG plant trait product.
In particular, because of the limited spatial domain of existing imaging spectroscopy data, trait retrieval algorithms have typically been developed and evaluated only for specific sites and under specific measurement conditions (e.g., instrument characteristics, atmospheric conditions, sun-sensor geometries), and the performance of these same algorithms at other sites and measurement conditions has not been investigated.

This manuscript is motivated by the following research questions:
(1) How large are uncertainties in trait retrievals from imaging spectroscopy?
(2) What are the largest sources of uncertainties in these retrievals?
To address these questions, we performed a simulation study that proceeded as follows:
First, starting from a known surface reflectance image, we used an atmospheric radiative transfer model to simulate satellite observations of radiance over a wide range of mission architectures and atmospheric conditions.
Second, for each simulated radiance measurement, we performed atmospheric correction to estimate surface reflectance (with uncertainty).
Finally, for each of these estimated reflectance spectra, we estimated plant trait values using existing models and evaluated the sources of variability and uncertainty across the simulations.

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Input data}\label{subsec:input-data}

\emergencystretch 2em  % Fix problematic long texttt
We obtained atmospherically corrected surface reflectance imaging spectroscopy data from a National Ecological Observatory (NEON) Airborne Observing Platform (AOP) scene in the Upper East River basing of Colorado, USA (39.0$^{\circ}$ N, 106.9$^{\circ}$ W) as processed by \citeA{chadwick2020integrating} and available on Google Earth Engine under the collection \texttt{users/pgbrodrick/SFA/collections/ciacorn\_priority}.
Briefly, these data are from several NEON AOP flights performed in summer 2018.
NEON AOP data have a spatial resolution of 1 m and an average spectral resolution of 5 nm over the range 383 nm to 2512 nm.
The atmospheric correction routine was a custom application of the Atmospheric CORrection Now (ACORN‐6LX, Imspec LLC, Glendale) software package accounting for fine-scale variation in topography and sun-sensor geometry.

\fussy  % Return to defaults
To evaluate not just relative but also _absolute_ accuracy of plant trait retrievals, 
we used the same previously-selected canopy reflectance pixels as in \citeA{chadwick2020integrating},
which were paired with ground reference measurements of plant traits.
These pixels exhibit substantial variability in brightness and spectral character:
green reflectance (550 nm) ranges from XXX to XXX;
near-infrared reflectance (1100 nm) ranges from XXX to XXX;
and hyperspectral normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; XXX and XXX nm bands) varies from XXX to XXX (Figure~\ref{fig:input-summary}).

A complete description of the data and processing methods are provided in \citeA{chadwick2020integrating}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Simulation workflow}\label{subsec:workflow}

To explore the contributions of different uncertainty sources, we performed a simulation workflow (Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}) that consisted of three major steps:
First, starting from known surface reflectance (Section~\ref{subsec:input-data}), we simulated radiance as it would be measured by a satellite, accounting for different combinations of surface elevation, atmospheric composition, sun-sensor geometry, and detector characteristics (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio) (Section~\ref{subsec:}).
Second, for each of these simulated measurements, we performed atmospheric correction to estimate surface reflectance with uncertainty.
Third, for each of these estimated reflectance spectra, we estimated plant traits using existing models.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  % \includegraphics[options]{figures/path.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:workflow}\
    Hypertrace workflow.
  }
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Simulating measured radiance}\label{subsubsec:radiance}

Following \citeA{thompson2018optimal}, we model top-of-atmosphere radiance ($L_{TOA}$) as a function of incoming solar irradiance ($e_{0}$), surface reflectance ($\rho_{s}$), and three terms describing atmospheric optical properties:
the path reflectance ($\rho_{a}$), transmittance ($t$), and spherical albedo ($s$).
Assuming that the entire reflectance process is Lambertian, and accounting for the solar zenith angle ($\theta_{s}$), the expression for TOA radiance is:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
  L_{TOA} = \frac{e_{0}\cos(\theta_{s})}{\pi}\left( \rho_{a} + \frac{t \rho_{s}}{1 - s \rho_{s}} \right)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The atmospheric optical properties ($\rho_{a}$, $t$, and $s$) all vary as a function of atmospheric composition and sun-sensor geometry.
To estimate these quantities, we used a hybrid approach (sRTMnet, Brodrick et al.~\emph{in review}) that combines
an atmospheric radiative transfer model (RTM) based on a computationally efficient successive orders of scattering approximation~\cite<Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum-Vector, 6SV, version 2.1,>{kotchenova2006validation}
with a neural network-based emulator of a more advanced RTM~\cite<MODTRAN,>{berk2017validation}.

In our experiment, we calculated these values over a factorial combination of atmospheric conditions, sun-sensor geometries, and additional mission characteristics (Table~\ref{tab:combinations}).
For atmospheric conditions and surface elevation, we considered ten combinations identified as representative of global conditions (REF).
These combinations included
aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD) ranging from 0.09 to 0.802,
water vapor content ranging from 0.543 to 4.323 g cm$^{-2}$,
surface elevation ranging from 77 to 3571 m above sea level,
and two types of atmospheric profiles (REF): tropical and midlatitude summer (Table~\ref{tab:atmospheres}).
For sun-sensor geometries, we considered a factorial combination of observation dates and times (which, combined with observation location, determine the position of the sun), sensor zenith angle, and sensor relative (to the sun's position) azimuth angle.

To facilitate interpretation of the reflectance retrievals, we binned some reflectance calculations according to the following wavelength regions:
visible (``VIS'', $[380, 680)$ nm), % chktex 9
red edge (``RE'', $[680, 750)$ nm), % chktex 9
near-infrared (``NIR'', $[750, 1350]$ nm),
shortwave infrared 1 (``SWIR1'', $[1470, 1780]$ nm),
and shortwave infrared 2 (``SWIR2'', $[2000, 2450]$ nm).

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

  }
\end{figure}

Simulated top-of-atmosphere radiance varied in predictable ways with atmospheric composition and sun-sensor-target geometry (Figure~\ref{fig:radiance}).
Increasing aerosol optical depth increased simulated radiance in the visible (400--700 nm) region, as expected from the scattering properties of aerosols.
Increasing water vapor concentration reduced simulated radiance in regions of the spectrum associated with strong water absorption (around 900 nm and 1400 nm).
Simulated radiance was highly sensitive to observation time, with maximum values across the spectrum at local solar noon and lower values earlier or later in the day.
Surface elevation affects radiance by modifying the contribution of atmospheric scattering and attenuation relative to the contribution of surface reflectance;
therefore, a higher-elevation surface is darker in the visible region (because of reduced aerosol scattering) and brighter around the atmospheric water vapor absorption bands (because of reduced water vapor).
Observer relative azimuth angle had only a minimal influence on top-of-atmosphere radiance (results not shown).

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
